            <p class="page-tagline">Simple tips to preserve the sparkle for a lifetime.</p>
            <img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/1E1E1E/D4AF37?text=Sparkling+Clean+Jewellery" alt="A collection of clean, sparkling jewellery.">
            <p>Fine jewellery is an investment in beauty and memories. To ensure it lasts a lifetime and beyond, proper care is essential. Daily wear exposes your pieces to skin oils, lotions, dust, and chemicals that can dull their shine. Follow these simple tips to keep your treasures looking as brilliant as the day you got them.</p>

            <h2>General Care: The Do's and Don'ts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do</strong> store your jewellery in a clean, dry place. A fabric-lined jewellery box with compartments is ideal to prevent pieces from scratching each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't</strong> wear your jewellery in swimming pools or spas. Chlorine can damage and discolor precious metals and gemstones.</li>
                <li><strong>Do</strong> put on your jewellery last, after applying makeup, perfume, and hairspray. These products contain chemicals that can harm your pieces.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't</strong> wear delicate jewellery during strenuous activities like exercising or gardening to prevent physical damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Clean Your Jewellery at Home</h2>
            <p>A simple cleaning solution can do wonders. For most gold and diamond jewellery, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix a few drops of mild dish soap (like Pril or Vim liquid) in a bowl of warm (not hot) water.</li>
                <li>Soak your jewellery for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Gently scrub the piece with a new, very soft-bristled baby toothbrush. Pay special attention to the areas behind stones where dirt accumulates.</li>
                <li>Rinse thoroughly under warm running water.</li>
                <li>Pat dry with a soft, lint-free cloth.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>When to Seek Professional Help</h2>
            <p>At least once a year, it's a good idea to take your frequently worn pieces to a trusted jeweller. They can perform a professional deep clean and, more importantly, check the settings and prongs to ensure your precious stones are secure. This preventative maintenance can save you from losing a valuable diamond or gemstone.</p>
