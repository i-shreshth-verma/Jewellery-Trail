            <p>When you buy gold jewellery in India, you'll constantly hear the terms '22-karat' and '24-karat'. While both refer to gold, they are not the same. Understanding the difference is key to knowing the value, durability, and suitability of your purchase.</p>
            
            <h2>What is 24-Karat Gold?</h2>
            <p>24k gold is the purest form of gold you can get. It is about 99.9% pure gold, with no other metals mixed in. Because of its purity, it has a distinct, bright yellow color. However, pure gold is very soft and malleable, which means it can bend and scratch easily. Therefore, 24k gold is not ideal for making regularly worn jewellery. It is most commonly used for making gold coins, bars, and some medical devices.</p>

            <h2>What is 22-Karat Gold?</h2>
            <p>22k gold is what most gold jewellery in India is made from. It consists of 22 parts gold and 2 parts of other metals like silver, zinc, or copper. This mixture, called an alloy, makes the gold harder and more durable, and thus suitable for crafting intricate jewellery that can withstand daily wear. The addition of other metals slightly tones down the bright yellow color of 24k gold.</p>

            <h2>Key Differences at a Glance</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purity:</strong> 24k is 99.9% pure, while 22k is 91.67% pure.</li>
                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> 22k is much more durable and stronger than the soft and pliable 24k gold.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Since it contains more gold, 24k gold is more expensive per gram than 22k gold.</li>
                <li><strong>Use:</strong> 24k is best for investment (coins/bars), while 22k is the standard for durable jewellery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Importance of Hallmarking</h2>
            <p>Regardless of the karat, always look for the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) hallmark on your jewellery. This is a government certification that guarantees the purity of the gold you are buying, protecting you as a consumer. A hallmarked piece will have the BIS logo, the karat purity (e.g., 22K916), and a unique identification mark.</p>
