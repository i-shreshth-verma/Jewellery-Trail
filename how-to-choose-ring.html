            <p>Choosing an engagement ring is a significant milestone. It’s a symbol of love and commitment that will be worn for a lifetime. With so many options available, the process can feel overwhelming. This guide will break down the key factors to consider, helping you make an informed and confident choice.</p>
            
            <h2>Understanding the 4 Cs</h2>
            <p>The 4 Cs are the global standard for assessing the quality of a diamond. Understanding them is the first step to finding the perfect stone.</p>
            <h3>1. Cut</h3>
            <p>Often considered the most important 'C', the cut determines the diamond's brilliance and sparkle. It’s not about the shape (like round or princess), but about how well the diamond's facets interact with light. A well-cut diamond will reflect light beautifully, creating that signature sparkle.</p>
            <h3>2. Color</h3>
            <p>The diamond color grade actually refers to the lack of color. A chemically pure and structurally perfect diamond has no hue, like a drop of pure water. The GIA's D-to-Z color-grading system measures the degree of colorlessness.</p>
            <h3>3. Clarity</h3>
            <p>Diamond clarity is the assessment of small imperfections on the surface (blemishes) and within the stone (inclusions). A flawless diamond is incredibly rare and valuable.</p>
            <h3>4. Carat</h3>
            <p>Carat refers to the diamond's weight, not its size. While a higher carat weight generally means a larger diamond, the cut can also affect how large the stone appears.</p>

            <h2>Choosing a Style</h2>
            <p>Once you understand the diamond, consider the ring's style. Is your partner's taste modern, vintage, or classic? The setting and the metal (yellow gold, white gold, platinum) play a huge role in the final look. The best advice is to observe the jewellery they already wear to get clues about their personal style.</p>
